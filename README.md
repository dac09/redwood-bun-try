# Redwood + Bun.sh

Trying it out
1. Created the ./bun folder with code transpiled from the web folder (I have code elsewhere to let me do this)
2. Added public/index.html in the bun folder with a script tag pointing at src/index.js
3. Ran `bun bun src/index.js` in the bun folder
4. Ran `bun` in the bun folder to serve the app
